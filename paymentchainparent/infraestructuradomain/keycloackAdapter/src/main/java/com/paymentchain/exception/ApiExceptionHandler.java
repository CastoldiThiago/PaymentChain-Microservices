 * Standard http communication have five levels of response codes
 * 100-level (Informational) — Server acknowledges a request, it mean that request was received and understood, it is transient response , alert client for awaiting response
 * 200-level (Success) — Server completed the request as expected
 * 300-level (Redirection) — Client needs to perform further actions to complete the request
 * 400-level (Client error) — Client sent an invalid request
 * 500-level (Server error) — Server failed to fulfill a valid request due to an error with server
 * 
 * The goal of handler exception is provide to customer with appropriate code and 
 * additional comprehensible information to help troubleshoot the problem. 
 * The message portion of the body should be present as user interface, event if 
 * customer send an Accept-Language header (en or french ie) we should translate the title part 
 * to customer language if we support internationalization, detail is intended for developer
 * of clients, so the translation is not necessary. If more than one error is need to report , we can 
 * response a list of errors.
